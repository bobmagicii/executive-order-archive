	<h2>Data Sources</h2>
	<hr />
	<p>The data was retireved from the
	<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov" target="_blank">Office of the
	Federal Register</a>, a part of the National Archives and Records
	Administration of the United States Federal Government. They provide this
	data to the public free of charge through their JSON API. Additionally,
	I have archived all the PDF versions of these documents locally that were
	available. The dataset contains all presidential documents which could
	have affect on your life - documents which could and do behave as a pseudo
	law, not just executive orders. It also contains a lot of pointless
	documents they have done.</p>

	<p>It is not a complete dataset, it appears they did not start making the
	presidential documents accessable until a bit after President William
	Clinton took office. Additionally, the first many of his documents do not
	have any PDF versions available according to the Federal Register's
	dataset.</p>

	<p>This data DOES contain errors. I have personally hand corrected many
	that were very obvious. For example, according to the Federal Register
	there were at least two documents that were signed by President William
	Clinton, but the API claimed that that document was signed by President
	George W Bush. To correct errors like this I referenced the PDF of the
	document to confirm the signature within. The Federal Register has been
	contacted as errors are found but of course government never responds
	unless you are in trouble.</p>

	<p>All charts on this site are generated by the data retrieved from the
	Federal Register and are hereby trusted to be responsible and accurate.
	However, by no means should you trust this data or any charts to make any
	decisions without first doing the proper research.</p>
	</p>

	<p>This site checks for new documents once a day. Most of the presidential
	documents, at least lately, are generally not published by the Federal
	Reserve until a few days after they are signed, and sometimes they are
	published in bulk only every few days.</p>

	<hr />
	<p>This is just a little project I did on my own free will because until
	Donald Trump took the presidential office, I personally did not fully
	understand how powerful some of these documents they write can be without
	having any sort of check and balance by the other two branches of
	government. And I know others were in the same boat as me, all the sudden
	Donald Trump is doing all these things, laying down enforceable law
	without congress approval or the justice system being like &quot;wait you
	can't just do that...&quot; which to me personally made it feel like High
	School civics class was a load of crap.</p>

	<p>Turns out, it kind of was.</p>

	<p>All I want is to provide a way for anyone to look up these documents
	and read the actual text so that they may understand what is really going
	on without having to search high and low or trust word of mouth.
	Additionally it is my hope that by making these documents more accessible
	that more people will actually check them out, and either call out
	indescrepencies from the text to the governments action or hold the
	government more accountable to their words.</p>

	<p>The source for this project is open, released under the BSD 2-Clause
	licence, and available at the Github link at the top of the page. If
	you use my code to make a public site all I ask is you change this about
	page to be about you rather than about me as it is now, and link back
	to the original project.</p>

	please feel free to contact me bob at nether dot io, or on Twitter.</p>
